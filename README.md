# N Queens Problem
N Queens Problem Solved With the Standard and 180 degree Symmetrical<br/>

Video Showing 180 degree symmetrical solution <br/>  
[I ran the Queens problem showing all the solutions the program was checking to find the 180 degree symmetrical solution up until I got to the 9 x 9 solution because Animating all posible solution is very time consuming, so I then switched to just showing the final solution]
