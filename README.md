# N Queens Problem

N Queens Problem Solved the Standard way using RECURSION.<br/>
Then solved with the 180 degree Symmetrical solution using RECURSION.<br/><br/>

# Description

The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general n queens problem of placing non-attacking queens on an n×n chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n=2 and n=3.


To extend	the	N	queens problem,	we added more	constraints	to the solutions.	There	exist	solutions of the N queens problem, which is 180 degrees symmetrical.

# 180 Degree Symmetrical Solution

Video Showing 180 degree symmetrical solution using RECURSION <br/>  
[I ran the Queens problem showing all the solutions the program was checking to find the 180 degree symmetrical solution up until I got to the 9 x 9 solution because Animating all posible solution is very time consuming, so I then switched to just showing the final solution. Showing 4x4 through 16X16 symmetrical solution]
